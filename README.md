# Ad-Hoc-Indoor-Positioning-System

An indoor positioning system (IPS) is a network of devices used to locate people or objects where GPS and other satellite technologies lack precision or fail entirely, such as inside tourists places, multistory buildings, airports, alleys, parking garages, and underground locations. aThe Indoor Positioning System can be developed using different types of radio waves present in the environment depending on one application to another. My system uses WiFi based radio waves present in the environment, which are being emitted from different WiFi Access Points.
